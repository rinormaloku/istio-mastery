This is the repo for the new series that picks up where **"[Learn Kubernetes in Under 3 Hours](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/learn-kubernetes-in-under-3-hours-a-detailed-guide-to-orchestrating-containers-114ff420e882)"** left us and continues with an introduction to the Service Mesh **"Istio"**. We will be introduced to the benefits of Istio and how it extends the capabilities of Kubernetes to simplify microservice applications by easily adding:

-	**Traffic management:** Timeouts, retries, canary rollouts, 
-	**Security:** End-user Authentication and Authorization,
-	**Observability:** Tracing, monitoring and logging.
